## Release Log
### 0.1.1 - February 6th 2020
Note: 
- Actions Q & W are identical
- Actions E & R are identical

Fixed:
- Waypoint marker was glitching out, behavior is as intended now.
- Due to unintended behavior, the player now "dies" on impact with an enemy.
- Zoom was not smoothed, it is now as intended.
