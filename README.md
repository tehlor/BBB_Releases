## Release Log
### 0.1.1 - February 6th 2020
Note: 
- Actions Q, W, E and R all do different things.
    - Q is a 6 count radial mine drop. Requires your ship to slow to 10% speed for 3 secs to release.
    - W is a 1 count sniper shot. Long cooldown and does 3 damage.
    - E is a 5 count spread shot. Instead of damage it permanently slows the target by 5 units.
    - R is a 7 count spread shot. Does 8 damage.

Fixed:
- Waypoint marker was glitching out, behavior is as intended now.
- Due to unintended behavior, the player now "dies" on impact with an enemy.
- Zoom was not smoothed, it is now as intended.
